# üß† Research Paper Summarization & Classification System

This project is a Streamlit-powered application that allows users to upload research paper PDFs, generate text summaries, classify them into user-specified topics, and even generate audio summaries with the help of Text-to-Speech.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhiraut/Research_Paper_Summarization_Multi_Agent_System.git
   cd Research-Paper-Analyzer
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # OR
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

---

This monolithic app (app.py) mimics a multi-agent system through modular logic. Each function represents an agent role:

| Agent                      | Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üìÑ PDF Text Extractor     | Uses PyMuPDF to extract clean text from uploaded PDFs               |
| üß† Topic Classifier Agent   | Classifies paper content using `zero-shot-classification`.               |
| ‚úçÔ∏è Summarizer Agent         | Uses transformer models to generate concise summaries.                   |
| üéôÔ∏è Audio Generation Agent  | Converts summary text into audio with `gTTS`.                            |

Each logical module acts independently and communicates via function calls, allowing future conversion into fully decoupled microservices or agent-based components.

## üìö Paper Processing Methodology

- **PDF Parsing:** PyMuPDF is used to extract readable text from academic papers.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Text is truncated (to ~2000 characters) for model efficiency and to prevent overloading Hugging Face-hosted spaces.
- **Summarization:** A lightweight model (`sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`) provides short, coherent summaries.
- **Topic Classification:** Topics entered by the user are matched against paper content using `valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-3`.

---

## üîä Audio Generation Implementation

- **Library:** [gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)
- **Workflow:**
  1. Summary is passed to gTTS.
  2. Speech is synthesized into an MP3 file.
  3. The MP3 is returned to Streamlit and embedded in the UI.
- **Limitations:** Requires internet access; not fully offline-compatible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Future Improvements

### ‚ùå Limitations

- **Model limitations:** Hugging Face Spaces have limited memory; heavy models like GPT or BART-large may crash.
- **No cross-paper synthesis:** The system only handles one paper at a time.
- **TTS requires internet:** gTTS does not work offline.
- **No persistent storage:** Summaries/audio are not saved or archived.

### ‚úÖ Future Improvements

- Replace gTTS with an **offline TTS engine** like `Coqui` or `pyttsx3`.
- Integrate **cross-paper synthesis** and trend summarization.
- Use **background processing** or async queues (e.g., Celery) for scalability.
- Deploy separate **backend microservices** for each agent role.
- Add **search functionality** via arXiv API or Semantic Scholar.
- Incorporate **DOI and URL parsing** to ingest external papers.

## üß† Author Notes

This project is intended as a prototype for research analysis via LLMs. It focuses on core logic, interpretability, and deployability within a lightweight, serverless container like Hugging Face Spaces.
